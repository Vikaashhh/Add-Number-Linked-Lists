### 🔗 Problem: Add Numbers Represented by Linked Lists
### 📌 Level: Medium
### 🧠 Core Focus: Linked List Addition, Carry Propagation
### 🏁 Status: ✅ Problem Solved Successfully

## 🧩 Problem Overview:
We are given two numbers represented by linked lists, where each node contains a single digit. The digits are stored in forward order. The task is to add the two numbers and return the result as a linked list in the same format.

## 🔍 Key Challenges:
- Reversing the linked list to enable least significant digit processing first.

- Managing carry-over values during addition.

- Ensuring proper handling when one list is shorter than the other.

- Constructing the result in forward order after computation.

## ⚙️ Conceptual Strategy:
- Reverse both linked lists to process digits from least to most significant.

- Traverse both lists simultaneously, summing values and maintaining a carry.

- Construct the result list using a dummy node.

- Reverse the final result to restore the original forward format.

## ✅ Submission Stats:
✔️ Test Cases Passed: 1111 / 1111

🧠 Accuracy: 100%

🔁 Attempts: 1 / 1

⏱️ Time Taken: 2.75 seconds

🏅 Points Earned: 4 / 4

## 📊 Complexity:
- Time Complexity: O(max(N, M))

- Space Complexity: O(max(N, M)) (for result list and auxiliary space)

## 🌱 Learning Reflection:
This problem beautifully illustrates how modular problem decomposition (reverse → compute → reverse back) can simplify complex tasks. It also reinforces the importance of careful pointer handling and edge case management in linked lists.
